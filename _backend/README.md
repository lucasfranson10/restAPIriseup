# Slim Framework 4 Skeleton Application

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton?branch=master)

Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Slim Framework 4 application. This application uses the latest Slim 4 with Slim PSR-7 implementation and PHP-DI container implementation. It also uses the Monolog logger.

This skeleton application was built for Composer. This makes setting up a new Slim Framework application quick and easy.

## Install the Application

Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Slim Framework application.

```bash
composer create-project slim/slim-skeleton [my-app-name]
```

Replace `[my-app-name]` with the desired directory name for your new application. You'll want to:

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's `public/` directory.
* Ensure `logs/` is web writable.

To run the application in development, you can run these commands 

```bash
cd [my-app-name]
composer start
```

Or you can use `docker-compose` to run the app with `docker`, so you can run these commands:
```bash
cd [my-app-name]
docker-compose up -d
```
After that, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

Run this command in the application directory to run the test suite

```bash
composer test
```

That's it! Now go build something cool.

## To use this app

For the application to work, you must edit the Migration.php file, which can be found in the db folder. This PHP file must be configured with your database entries.

set to the config-phinx.php

After finish you have to run the next command:

php vendor/bin/phinx migrate -c config-phinx.php

That command will set the table for your database.

In App/settings.php you have to set the database too.

To run the server run:

 php -S 0.0.0.0:8081 -t public public/index.php
